# TEXT GENERATION USING LSTM
The project implements a text generation model using LSTM neural networks to generate coherent text sequences based on input data.

# Data Set
It is the paragraph of the information about education.

# Libraries

- numpy as np: Used for numerical computations and array operations.
- pandas as pd: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling tabular data structures like DataFrames.
- os: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as file operations and directory manipulation.
- re: Allows for regular expression pattern matching and manipulation of strings.
- nltk.corpus.stopwords: Provides a list of common stopwords that can be filtered out from text data.
- tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer: Used for tokenizing text data and converting it into sequences of integers.
- tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences: Used to pad sequences to ensure uniform length, which is often necessary for input into neural networks.
- tensorflow.keras.utils.to_categorical: Utilized to convert categorical labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
- tensorflow.keras.layers.LSTM, tensorflow.keras.layers.Dropout, tensorflow.keras.layers.Dense, tensorflow.keras.layers.Embedding: Layers used to construct the LSTM-based neural network model.
- tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential: Allows for the sequential stacking of layers to create a neural network model.
- tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential.fit(): Used to train the neural network model.

# Functions

- Data Handling: The code reads text data from a specified file path and preprocesses it by cleaning and tokenizing the text.
- Model Preparation: It prepares the text data for input into an LSTM-based neural network model by converting it into sequences of tokens and padding the sequences to ensure uniform length.
- Model Construction: Using Keras, the code constructs a sequential neural network model comprising an embedding layer, an LSTM layer for sequence modeling, dropout layer for regularization, and a dense output layer for text prediction.
- Model Training: The constructed model is compiled with appropriate loss function and optimizer and trained on the prepared input sequences and their corresponding labels.
- Text Generation: After training, the model can generate text sequences based on an initial input string using the learned patterns and probabilities of the text data.
